# Change Request
Once we complete the handover of your service details, you may find that you need to increase the specification of your virtual instance. This is particularly useful for projects with short-term and urgent or long-term requirements.

We consider these requests on a case-by-case basis. We will honour your request, providing we have the required resources available. Requests from existing projects who have already been approved for our services will be prioritized, making this a much faster procedure.

You can solicit change requests [here](https://support.fossho.st/). We will process your request within 24 hours; if your request is urgent, we can do this much sooner.
