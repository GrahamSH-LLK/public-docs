# How to connect to your virtual instance


Fosshost's virtual instances are Linux-based VMs that run on top of virtualized hardware. Each one you create is a new server you can use, either standalone or as part of a larger cloud-based infrastructure.

Virtual instances are managed using a terminal and SSH. You'll need to have an SSH client and an SSH key pair. We do not provide virtual instances with plain password authentication. 

## SSH


You can access your virtual instance by using SSH. A comparison of SSH clients is available [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_SSH_clients).

To connect to your instance, you will need its hostname or IP address. This will be provided in your handover email.
