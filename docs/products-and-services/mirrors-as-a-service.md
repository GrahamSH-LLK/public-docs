# Mirrors-as-a-Service

The project runs an open-source mirror for several open-source projects.   

Mirrors Link: [https://mirrors.fossho.st](https://mirrors.fossho.st) 

We have partnered with [Fastly CDN](https://fastly.com) to improve Mirrors-as-a-Service and provide more [global locations](https://www.fastly.com/network-map).

## Requirements


When applying for the mirrors service please ensure you provide an rsync:// url during your application.

You can read more about how to set up rsync [here](https://linux.die.net/man/5/rsyncd.conf).

We will mirror / sync from this source.  We will not provide this to you.

If you are unsure how to set up rsync mirrors for mirroring; please contact us via IRC/discord and ask to speak to our mirrors admin, Ben Harri.  If he is unavailable, other volunteers will be able to assist you.
